Socket Express
=============

When realtime and stateless HTTP get together, and live happily ever after.
HMVC framework built on top of [SocketStream](https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream) and [Express.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org),
inspired somehow by the simplicity of PHP Kohana framework (sorry, not another Rails clone for Node for you)

Using nothing more than already existing packages in NPM but with some consistent glue together.

Highlights
=============

* No DSL
* No new jargon to learn
* Plain Javascript (or Coffeescript if you fancy that)
* Nothing is enforced, you only need to follow folder strucuture
* Convention over configuration
